I am Juma, a 26-year-old software engineering student at ALX. I am passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cyber security. 
I have a BSc in Electrical Engineering from Dedan Kimathi University, which gives me a strong understanding of the underlying hardware and software that makes computers work.
In my studies, I have focused on mastering AI, machine learning, and cyber security. I have completed several projects in these areas, including:
The ALX Simple Shell project, which is a command-line interpreter that I implemented in C. 
This project required me to learn about the Linux operating system and the C programming language. 
It helped me to develop my skills in modular programming, debugging, and working independently.
I am a hard worker and I am always looking for new challenges. I am confident that I can make a positive impact on the world through my work in software engineering.
Let's connect and collaborate to solve problems in software engoneering.
